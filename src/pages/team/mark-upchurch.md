Mark started his construction career almost 50 years ago building a barn on his family's farm in Raleigh, North Carolina. As a young boy, this is when is father taught him the foundations of construction and the value of hardwork. While he did not get paid in money, he definitely earned his meals that summer. Not only did Mark learn the basics of construction, he learned these skills are valueless without pride and quality in your work.

Mark has built his career on these values. Mark's pride in his work motivates him to ensure that work is done in a timely manner and up to his quality standards, as well as the customers and, of course, law. This is why companies such as Darden, Dominoes and Quicktrip continue to call Mark when they need to "get things done."
