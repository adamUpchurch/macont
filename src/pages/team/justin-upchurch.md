A tale as old as time. You know how the story goes. A balcksmith's teaching his son to forge. A fisherman teaching his to tie a knot. A carpenter teaching his son to swing a hammer. Each generation passing on the knowledge of his father and the lessons he learnt over the years. This story is no different. Mark has groomed Justin into the young but seasoned professional that he is today.

You can tell Mark has done a great job because the two traits that set Mark a part from others in the industry are obvious in Justin's work ethic. He has an unwavering pride in what he builds. You can see this in the quality of his work.
